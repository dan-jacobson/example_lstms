# example_lstms
A project training various example LSTMs (with checkpoints!)

This project borrows mainly Karpathy's min-char-rnn.py file (from here https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086) and updates to use Pytorch datasets, LSTM layers, etc.
I've also incorporated a few small functions and tricks.

I've trained this model on the Shakespeare corpus (TODO: add link).

Checkpoints for the trained models can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15uR-o9p3tPLedNKmfBQz4Dqnoh7YtVQn.

Enjoy!
